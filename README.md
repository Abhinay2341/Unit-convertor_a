# Unit-converter
## Converts one unit to other units

A unit converter is a tool that allows you to convert values from one unit of measurement to another. It is a very useful tool for anyone who needs to work with different units of measurement, whether it's in science, engineering, or everyday life.Unit converters can convert a wide range of units, including length, weight, volume, temperature, and more. For example, if you need to convert a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit, a unit converter can quickly and easily do the calculation for you.Instead of having to manually calculate conversions using formulas or reference tables, you can simply input the value you want to convert and select the units you want to convert it to. This can save a lot of time and effort, especially when you need to convert many values.
